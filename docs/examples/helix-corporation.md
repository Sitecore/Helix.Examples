# Helix Corporation (Forthcoming)

This example will demonstrate a more complex multi-site architecture and
functionality following Sitecore Helix practices.

* Multi-site, with sufficiently different front-end to necessitate different markup per site (use MVC areas?)
* Include some site-specific renderings
* Per-site languages w/ translation
* Integrated, Helix-patterned client code?
* Site-specific datasource locations
* Dictionary use
* Feature-to-Feature communication examples (dependency inversion approaches)
* Reference for other recipes / how-to's
