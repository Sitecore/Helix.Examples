# Welcome to the Sitecore Helix Examples

The Sitecore Helix Examples are demonstrations of Sitecore Helix practices across various
tooling and business scenarios. They are intended to demonstrate a wider variety
of implementation types / requirements than existing examples.

## What is Sitecore Helix?

*Sitecore Helix* is a collection of **recommended practices** and
**conventions** for the **solution architecture** of Sitecore product
implementations.

## Getting Started

Interested in exploring these examples? You can...

* [Read more about the examples](examples.md) included in this repository.
* [Install one or more examples](install.md) locally to explore them.
* ... or just [explore the code](https://github.com/Sitecore/Helix.Examples/tree/master/examples)!

## Intended Usage

The Helix Examples are not:
* Sales/Marketing demo sites (see Habitat Home)
* A 'getting started' guide for Sitecore (see https://doc.sitecore.com/developers) 
* A 'starter kit' for Helix-based sites (there are several of these in the community)

You can certainly reference and reuse code found here. However you should take care
when doing so, like you could copying code from Stackexchange or other sources,
and adjust to your needs. As much as possible, these examples strive to follow good
Sitecore practices beyond Helix.

The SIF-based install/menu/configuration system however is optimized to ease and bring joy to
the installation of the multiple example instances, and likely is not a good fit for
production projects. However we do hope you enjoy using it.
